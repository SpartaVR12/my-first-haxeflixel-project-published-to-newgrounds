1. Install Haxe 4.3.7 (WINDOWS INSTALLER) on https://haxe.org/download/version/4.3.7/

2. After that, go to the windows search bar, type "cmd", then click "Run As Administrator". This opens the Command Prompt.

(JUST REMEMBER: IF YOU HAVE OLDER VERSIONS OF THE HAXELIB STUFF, TYPE IN "haxelib upgrade".)
(JUST REMEMBER: IF YOU WANT TO CHECK YOUR VERSIONS OF YOUR HAXELIB STUFF, TYPE IN "haxelib list".)

4. If you want to compile (build) the project, do the following:

1. Go to the Command Prompt app.
2. Type in the Command Prompt "cd C:\Users\JohnDoe\Downloads\my-first-haxeflixel-project-published-on-newgrounds-main"
3. After that, type in "lime test windows" or "lime build windows". It will build the project for you.

That is how you install haxe, haxeflixel's components, and build the game. Goodbye!
